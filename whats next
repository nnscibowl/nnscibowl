Some Ideas:
- Add a resources page (If the page is used purely for advertising then maybe not idk)
- Add a contact us page
- Fix the logo thing in the upper left corner. It leads to google.com, which is weird
- The logo also does some weird things when you scroll down. For example, if you go to the About page and scroll down, the logo is too big for the header region.
- Also we should put the discord invite somewhere in the website
- Can we add a footer? maybe it would help with navigation
- We can also consider adding a "news" page where we add recent news. maybe?
- Is it possible to simplify the url? it seems a little long for people to remember
